Course project for a full-stack MongoDB + Express.js + React.js bug tracker web app.

## Development

### Tech

Use Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB and React.js.

### Caveats

Consider that the current ID/Code generation is simple and should not be used into 
production.

MongoDB is not suitable for relational databases and recall that most business
problems always have relations. I would recommend using a relational SQL database
instead or else a serverless solution like Firebase for rapid development or prototyping.

## Bonus

This other app is a bonus. It was a test I did for the course, and it's also a
React app: [React Notes](./react-notes).
